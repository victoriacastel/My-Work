# My Work
A compilation of various projects I have done through my studies at Miami University.

## Covid-19 Dashboard
An interactive app created with R Shiny and Covid-19 data from April 2020 to December 2021. Web-based version: https://victoriacastel.shinyapps.io/Project2/. Completed Fall 2023.

## Freestore Foodbank Intership Project
A static dashboard that helped management decide whether or not to change the location of one of their food pantries. Client data and US Census data were used to complete this project. Note the data used is not available, but the code is. Completed January 2023.

## SAS Macro
A macro about the frequency of police calls by day of the week and year. A Word document is output, showing the frequency of the user-specified crime by the day of the week, across the years in the dataset. Note the data used is too large to upload, but I am more than happy to provide it upon request! Completed Fall 2023.
