# My Work
A compilation of various projects I have done through my studies at Miami University, ranging from my sophomore year to my senior year, and mostly done in R.

## Covid-19 Dashboard
An interactive app created with R Shiny and Covid-19 data from April 2020 to December 2021. Web-based version: https://victoriacastel.shinyapps.io/Project2/

## Freestore Foodbank Intership Project
A static dashboard that helped management decide whether or not to change the location of one of their food pantries. Client data and US Census data were used to complete this project. Note the data used is not available, but the code is.

## SAS Macro
A macro about the frequency of police calls by day of the week and year. A Word document is output, showing the frequency of the user-specified crime by the day of the week, across the years in the dataset.
